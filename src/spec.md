# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) and macro calculator to help users determine their daily calorie and macronutrient needs based on their fitness goals.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a TDEE calculator component that accepts user inputs (weight, height, age, gender, activity level, fitness goal)
- Display calculated TDEE in calories per day
- Show recommended daily macros breakdown (protein, carbs, fats in grams)
- Include explanation of calculations/formula used
- Integrate calculator into client dashboard as a new accessible tab/section
- Follow existing UI patterns and styling for consistency

**User-visible outcome:** Users can access a TDEE calculator from their client dashboard to calculate their daily calorie needs and macro breakdown based on their personal metrics and fitness goals, with clear explanations of the calculations.
