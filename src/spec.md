## Summary
**Goal:** Add a detailed exercise library with seven specific exercises and a comprehensive six-meal diet plan template with Indian food options.

**Planned changes:**
- Add seven exercises to the exercise library: Squats, Push-ups, Bench Press, Deadlift, Pull-ups/Lat Pulldown, Overhead Press, and Plank, each with sets, reps, muscle groups, and descriptions
- Create a diet plan template with six meal times (Breakfast, Mid-Morning, Lunch, Pre-Workout, Post-Workout, Dinner), each offering two food options with Indian meal choices
- Display all seven exercises in the exercise library interface with filtering by muscle group
- Display the comprehensive diet plan in the client dashboard showing all meal times with both food options clearly labeled

**User-visible outcome:** Gym members can view a complete exercise library with detailed workout information and access a structured diet plan with Indian food options for each meal time throughout the day.
