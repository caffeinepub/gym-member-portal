  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses both REQ-1 and REQ-2. A TDEE calculator component was created with all required inputs and calculations, and it was integrated into the client dashboard as a new tab. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the available evidence.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Collapsible explanation section with formula details",
      "reason": "REQ-1 requires 'explanation of calculations or formula used' but the implementation uses a collapsible/expandable UI pattern (Collapsible component from shadcn) which adds interactive UI complexity beyond what was specified. The requirement could be satisfied with static text.",

      "reason": "The implementation includes decorative icons (Calculator, Info, Zap) which were not requested in the requirements. While they enhance the UI, they represent added features beyond the specification.",

      "reason": "The implementation uses 'grid gap-6 lg:grid-cols-2' creating a responsive two-column layout. While this improves UX, the specific layout pattern was not requested. REQ-1 only specified 'clear, readable format with visual distinction'.",
