  "summary": "The implementation covers most backend and frontend requirements comprehensively. However, several acceptance criteria are partially implemented or missing: workout plan editing/deletion functionality is incomplete in the UI, client progress summaries for trainers are not visible, real-time branding updates may not fully work, and charts/graphs for client progress use basic implementations. The visual theme requirement (REQ-15) regarding energetic colors avoiding blue/purple is not evident in the code. Some features like live preview of branding changes are missing from the UI.",
